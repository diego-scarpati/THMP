/**
 * Checks if a candidate's experience meets the job description's requirement.
 *
 * The function looks for various phrasings that indicate an experience requirement:
 *   1. "Exactly X years" ‚Üí candidate must have exactly that number of years.
 *   2. "Between X and Y years" (or "Between X-Y years") ‚Üí candidate's experience must be within that range.
 *   3. "X-Y years" (without "between") ‚Üí another way to specify a range.
 *   4. Minimum requirement expressions:
 *        - "Minimum of X years"
 *        - "No less than X years"
 *        - "At least X years"
 *        - Shorthand notation "X+ years"
 *   5. "More than X years" or "Over X years" ‚Üí candidate must have strictly more than X years.
 *   6. Maximum requirement expressions:
 *        - "Maximum of X years"
 *        - "No more than X years"
 *        - "Not exceeding X years"
 *        - "Up to X years"
 *   7. Direct statements such as "Experience required: X years" or "X years experience required"
 *      (this is treated as a minimum requirement).
 *
 * If no experience-related phrase is detected, the function returns true (no explicit requirement).
 *
 * @param {string} jobDescription - The job description text.
 * @param {number} candidateExperience - The candidate's experience in years.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the candidate meets the requirement (or no requirement is specified), false otherwise.
